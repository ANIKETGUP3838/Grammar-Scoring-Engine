# 🎙️ Advanced Grammar Scoring Engine  
*A Streamlit-based Speech & Grammar Evaluation System*

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Advanced Grammar Scoring Engine** is an end-to-end AI application that evaluates spoken English by analyzing **audio quality, speech transcription, and grammatical correctness**. The system combines **speech recognition, NLP-based grammar analysis, audio feature extraction, and deep learning** to predict a grammar proficiency score.

This project demonstrates practical applications of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Audio Signal Processing** using real-world tools and models.
